<p>This is an internal package used by <code>vue-loader</code> and <code>vueify</code>. It processes the raw render functions generated by <code>vue-template-compiler</code> to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>add support to ES2015 features in template expressions via Buble. (see <a href="https://buble.surge.sh/guide/#supported-features">supported features here</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>remove the <code>with</code> block inside render functions to make it strict-mode compliant. This is performed only at build time so that the base template compiler can be extremely small and lightweight.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The buble implementation is built from a fork at https://github.com/yyx990803/buble</p>
