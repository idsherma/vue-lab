<h1>boolbase</h1>
<p>This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (<code>trueFunc</code>) and one that always returns false (<code>falseFunc</code>).</p>

<h3>WTF?</h3>

<p>By having only a single instance of these functions around, it’s possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. <a href="https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect"><code>CSSselect</code></a> uses these functions to determine whether a selector won’t match any elements. If that’s the case, the DOM doesn’t even have to be touched.</p>

<h3>And why is this a separate module?</h3>

<p>I’m trying to modularize <code>CSSselect</code> and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.</p>
