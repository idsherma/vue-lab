<h1>It Opens Stuff</h1>

<p>That is, in your desktop environment. This will make <em>actual windows pop up</em>, with stuff in them:</p>

<p>```bash
npm install opener -g</p>

<p>opener http://google.com
opener ./my-file.txt
opener firefox
opener npm run lint
```</p>

<p>Also if you want to use it programmatically you can do that too:</p>

<p>```js
var opener = require(“opener”);</p>

<p>opener(“http://google.com”);
opener(“./my-file.txt”);
opener(“firefox”);
opener(“npm run lint”);
```</p>

<p>Plus, it returns the child process created, so you can do things like let your script exit while the window stays open:</p>

<p><code>js
var editor = opener("documentation.odt");
editor.unref();
// These other unrefs may be necessary if your OS's opener process
// exits before the process it started is complete.
editor.stdin.unref();
editor.stdout.unref();
editor.stderr.unref();
</code></p>

<h2>Use It for Good</h2>

<p>Like opening the user’s browser with a test harness in your package’s test script:</p>

<p><code>json
{
    "scripts": {
        "test": "opener ./test/runner.html"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "opener": "*"
    }
}
</code></p>

<h2>Why</h2>

<p>Because Windows has <code>start</code>, Macs have <code>open</code>, and *nix has <code>xdg-open</code>. At least
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/1480971/3191">according to some guy on StackOverflow</a>. And I like things that work on all
three. Like Node.js. And Opener.</p>
