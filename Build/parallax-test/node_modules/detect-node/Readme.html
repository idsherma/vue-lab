<p>Usage:
```js
var isNode = require(‘detect-node’);</p>

<p>if (isNode) {
  console.log(“Running under Node.JS”);
} else {
  alert(“Hello from browser (or whatever not-a-node env)”);
}
```</p>

<p>The check is performed as:
```js
module.exports = false;</p>

<p>// Only Node.JS has a process variable that is of [[Class]] process
try {
 module.exports = Object.prototype.toString.call(global.process) === ‘[object process]’ 
} catch(e) {}</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Thanks to Ingvar Stepanyan for the initial idea. This check is both <strong>the most reliable I could find</strong> and it does not use <code>process</code> env directly, which would cause browserify to include it into the build.</p>
