<p>This is a fork based on <a href="https://github.com/webpack/style-loader">style-loader</a>. Similar to <code>style-loader</code>, you can chain it after <code>css-loader</code> to dynamically inject CSS into the document as style tags. However, since this is included as a dependency and used by default in <code>vue-loader</code>, in most cases you don’t need to configure this loader yourself.</p>

<h3>Differences from <code>style-loader</code></h3>

<h4>Server-Side Rendering Support</h4>

<p>When bundling with <code>target: 'node'</code>, the styles in all rendered components are collected and exposed on the Vue render context object as <code>context.styles</code>, which you can simply inline into your markup’s <code><head></code>. If you are building a Vue SSR app, you probably should use this loader for CSS imported from JavaScript files too.</p>

<h4>Misc</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Does not support url mode and reference counting mode. Also removed <code>singleton</code> and <code>insertAt</code> query options. It always automatically pick the style insertion mechanism that makes most sense. If you need these capabilities you should probably use the original <code>style-loader</code> instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed the issue that root-relative URLs are interpreted against chrome:// urls and make source map URLs work for injected <code><style></code> tags in Chrome.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
