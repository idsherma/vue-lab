<h1>fsevents <a href="https://nodei.co/npm/fsevents/"><img src="https://nodei.co/npm/fsevents.png" alt="NPM" /></a></h1>

<p>Native access to OS X FSEvents in <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a></p>

<p>The FSEvents API in OS X allows applications to register for notifications of
changes to a given directory tree. It is a very fast and lightweight alternative
to kqueue.</p>

<p>This is a low-level library. For a cross-compatible file watching module that
uses fsevents, check out <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar">Chokidar</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<pre><code>$ npm install fsevents
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p><code>js
var fsevents = require('fsevents');
var watcher = fsevents(__dirname);
watcher.on('fsevent', function(path, flags, id) { }); // RAW Event as emitted by OS-X
watcher.on('change', function(path, info) { }); // Common Event for all changes
watcher.start() // To start observation
watcher.stop()  // To end observation
</code></p>

<h3>Events</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>fsevent</em> - RAW Event as emitted by OS-X</li>
  <li><em>change</em> - Common Event for all changes</li>
  <li><em>created</em> - A File-System-Item has been created</li>
  <li><em>deleted</em> - A File-System-Item has been deleted</li>
  <li><em>modified</em> - A File-System-Item has been modified</li>
  <li><em>moved-out</em> - A File-System-Item has been moved away from this location</li>
  <li><em>moved-in</em> - A File-System-Item has been moved into this location</li>
</ul>

<p>All events except <em>fsevent</em> take an <em>info</em> object as the second parameter of the callback. The structure of this object is:</p>

<p><code>js
{
  "event": "<event-type>",
  "id": <eventi-id>,
  "path": "<path-that-this-is-about>",
  "type": "<file|directory|symlink>",
  "changes": {
    "inode": true, // Has the iNode Meta-Information changed
    "finder": false, // Has the Finder Meta-Data changed
    "access": false, // Have the access permissions changed
    "xattrs": false // Have the xAttributes changed
  },
  "flags": <raw-flags>
}
</code></p>
