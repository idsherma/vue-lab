<h1>2.1.7</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Replaced the <code>has-own</code> module with <code>has</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Â 2.1.6</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes an issue where the module would discard at-rules that were defined in
<code>@media</code> & <code>@supports</code> rules as well as the root. As this is legal to do in
CSS, the module now checks to see if the candidate rule has the same parent
as the cached rule. If it does, the rules are merged.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Now compiled with babel 6.</li>
</ul>
