<h1>Toposort</h1>

<p>Sort directed acyclic graphs</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p><code>npm install toposort</code> or <code>component install marcelklehr/toposort</code>  </p>

<p>then in your code:</p>

<p><code>js
toposort = require('toposort')
</code></p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>We want to sort the following graph.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/marcelklehr/toposort/8b14e9fd/graph.svg" alt="graph" /></p>

<p>```js
// First, we define our edges.
var graph = [
  [‘put on your shoes’, ‘tie your shoes’]
, [‘put on your shirt’, ‘put on your jacket’]
, [‘put on your shorts’, ‘put on your jacket’]
, [‘put on your shorts’, ‘put on your shoes’]
]</p>

<p>// Now, sort the vertices topologically, to reveal a legal execution order.
toposort(graph)
// [ ‘put on your shirt’
// , ‘put on your shorts’
// , ‘put on your jacket’
// , ‘put on your shoes’
// , ‘tie your shoes’ ]
```</p>

<p>(Note that there is no defined order for graph parts that are not connected
 – you could also put on your jacket after having tied your shoes…)</p>

<h3>Sorting dependencies</h3>
<p>It is usually more convenient to specify <em>dependencies</em> instead of “sequences”.
```js
// This time, edges represent dependencies.
var graph = [
  [‘tie your shoes’, ‘put on your shoes’]
, [‘put on your jacket’, ‘put on your shirt’]
, [‘put on your shoes’, ‘put on your shorts’]
, [‘put on your jacket’, ‘put on your shorts’]
]</p>

<p>toposort(graph) 
// [ ‘tie your shoes’
// , ‘put on your shoes’
// , ‘put on your jacket’
// , ‘put on your shirt’
// , ‘put on your shorts’ ]</p>

<p>// Now, reversing the list will reveal a legal execution order.
toposort(graph).reverse() 
// [ ‘put on your shorts’
// , ‘put on your shirt’
// , ‘put on your jacket’
// , ‘put on your shoes’
// , ‘tie your shoes’ ]
```</p>

<h2>API</h2>

<h3>toposort(edges)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>edges {Array} An array of directed edges describing a graph. An edge looks like this: <code>[node1, node2]</code> (vertices needn’t be strings but can be of any type).</li>
</ul>

<p>Returns: {Array} a list of vertices, sorted from “start” to “end”</p>

<h3>toposort.array(nodes, edges)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>nodes {Array} An array of nodes</li>
  <li>edges {Array} An array of directed edges. You don’t need to mention all <code>nodes</code> here.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a convenience method that allows you to define nodes that may or may not be connected to any other nodes. The ordering of unconnected nodes is not defined.</p>

<p>Returns: {Array} a list of vertices, sorted from “start” to “end”</p>

<h2>Tests</h2>

<p>Run the tests with <code>node test.js</code>.</p>
